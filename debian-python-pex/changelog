python-pex (1.1.14-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/patches/update-dependencies.patch: Remove ceiling dependency
    versions since we have (or may eventually have) newer versions
    which are still compatible.  This prevents trying to hit PyPI for
    setuptools and wheel dependencies we still satisfy.  
    (Closes: #838559)
  * d/control: pex works better with requests, so add python3-requests
    to Depends.

python-pex (1.1.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * d/patches/bump-setuptools-max-version.patch: Deleted; applied upstream.
  * d/control:
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.8 with no other changes needed.

  * New upstream release.
  * d/control:
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.7 with no other changes needed.
    - Update Vcs-Git header to https URL as per style guide.
  * d/tests/{control,execute.sh}: Revert Ubuntu accommodations.
  * d/patches: Updated by git-dpm.
  * d/rules: in override_dh_auto_clean, there's no need to remove the
    build/ directory explicitly, but we do need to remove the pex.1 file.

python-pex (1.1.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/control: Canonicalize the Vcs-* headers as per team standard.
  * d/patches/bump-wheel-requirement-version.patch: Added.
  * d/README.pex: Removed; upstream now includes the docs directory.
  * d/python-pex-docs -> python-pex-doc.docs; fix the path.
  * d/rules:
    - Added override_dh_installdocs to build the Sphinx documentation.
    - Added override_dh_auto_clean to remove the doc build directory.
  * d/tests:
    - Rewrite the execution test so that it's compatible between both
      Ubuntu and Debian, negating the need for an Ubuntu delta.  The extra
      required package is now conditionally installed depending on the
      dpkg-vendor.  Also, by setting http_proxy and https_proxy to the
      discard port, we ensure that pex cannot install from PyPI (it must
      use system packages to resolve dependencies in the test).
    - d/t/execute.sh: Added.
    - d/t/control: Call execute.sh instead of using a Test-Command, and
      add the needs-root Restriction (for the conditional `apt-get
      install` in the script).

  * d/patches/handle-pkg_resources-devendorization.patch: Work around

    with the manipulations of sys that pex employs.  (Closes: #781130)
  * d/patches/modern-install-requires.patch: Allow for setuptools
    12.2, fixing the manpage build.  (LP: #1435598)
